# Machine Learning Foundations Notes

Welcome.

This repository contains my structured lecture notes for the Machine Learning Foundations course.  
All notes are written carefully in LaTeX-style mathematics and organized week by week for clarity and continuity.

These notes are designed to:

- Preserve conceptual flow
- Include formal definitions and derivations
- Maintain mathematical precision
- Serve as a long-term reference

## About These Notes

All mathematical expressions are rendered using MathJax.

Inline math appears as: $x^2 + y^2$  
Display equations appear as:

$$
f : \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}
$$

The goal is not just to summarize lectures, but to internalize and reconstruct the theory in a structured way.

---

## Purpose

These notes serve as:

- A personal long-term reference
- A structured revision resource
- A public academic portfolio of learning

They will continue to evolve as the course progresses.
